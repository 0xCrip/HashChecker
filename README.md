### This is just a project created for fun. But anyone is welcome to it. 

### Also I came across an error during testing, but it may have just been specific to my wordlists formatting. Let me know if its the same for you.

### The wordlist is too big for GitHub but it was just the rockyou.txt that can be found with a quick google search. Although there are better options out there.
